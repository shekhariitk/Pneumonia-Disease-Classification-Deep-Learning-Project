                <h4>How It Works</h4>
                <p>
                    Our pneumonia detection system uses a deep learning model trained on five thousands of chest X-ray images
                    to identify signs of pneumonia. The model analyzes patterns in the X-ray images that are characteristic
                    of pneumonia infection.

                        This system is designed to assist healthcare professionals and should not be used as a sole diagnostic tool.
                        Always consult with a qualified medical professional for diagnosis and treatment.

                <h4>What is Pneumonia?</h4>
                <p>
                    Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with
                    fluid or pus, causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It can be caused by a variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Symptoms can range
                    from mild to severe and may require hospitalization.
                                                </p>

                <h4>Future Scope</h4>
                <p>
                    We aim to improve the model's accuracy by incorporating more diverse and huge datasets and advanced techniques
                    such as transfer learning . Future updates will also include features like real-time analysis and integration
                    with electronic health records.We can use GPUs to speed up the training process and improve the model's performance.
